# SegChurnAI

SegChurnAI is a data-driven project that combines customer segmentation and churn prediction to help businesses better understand customer behavior, personalize marketing strategies, and reduce churn rates.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project has two main objectives:

1. **Customer Segmentation**  
   Using clustering algorithms (like K-Means), customers are grouped based on income and spending behavior. This helps in:
   - Targeting marketing campaigns more effectively
   - Offering personalized services
   - Identifying high-value customers

2. **Churn Prediction**  
   A machine learning model is built to predict whether a customer is likely to churn. It also highlights key factors influencing churn, enabling:
   - Proactive retention strategies
   - Improved customer satisfaction
   - Cost savings in customer acquisition
